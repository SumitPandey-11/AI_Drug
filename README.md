# AI_Drug
This project focuses on predicting molecular toxicity using Graph Neural Networks (GCNs) with the Tox21 dataset. The implementation is done using DeepChem and TensorFlow. The model achieved a validation ROC-AUC of 0.83, demonstrating strong potential for AI-powered drug discovery. The notebook includes data loading, training, evaluation, and visualization steps.
